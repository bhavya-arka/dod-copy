The C-17 Globemaster III is a versatile strategic airlifter designed to carry a maximum payload of 170,900 pounds (77,519 kg) and operate with a maximum gross takeoff weight of 585,000 pounds. Its expansive cargo bay measures approximately 88 feet in length (including the ramp), 18 feet in width, and has a varying height of 12 feet 4 inches forward of the wing and 13 feet 6 inches at the aft. For standard logistics missions, the aircraft can accommodate up to 18 463L master pallets—arranged in two side-by-side rows of 9—with 14 pallets on the main floor and 4 on the ramp. In airdrop configurations, the aircraft typically carries 11 pallets along its centerline or up to 40 containers for the Container Delivery System (CDS). 
Powered by four Pratt & Whitney F117-PW-100 turbofan engines, each providing 40,440 pounds of thrust, the C-17 has a total fuel capacity of 28,000 gallons (approximately 181,054 pounds). While precise fuel consumption rates vary by payload and altitude, its unrefueled range is approximately 2,400 nautical miles when carrying a 169,000-pound load at a cruise speed of 450 knots (Mach 0.74). Beyond palletized cargo, the cargo compartment is flexible enough to transport outsize military equipment, such as one M1 Abrams tank or three Bradley armored vehicles, and can be configured with 54 permanent sidewall seats or additional palletized seating for up to 100 passengers. 

The Lockheed C-130H and C-130J represent two generations of tactical airlifters, with the newer "J" model (Super Hercules) offering significant improvements in efficiency and capacity through its stretched variant. 
Pallet and Personnel Capacity
The standard C-130H typically accommodates up to 6 pallets (though some configurations list 5) and can carry 92 combat troops or 64 paratroopers. The standard-length C-130J maintains this 6-pallet capacity. However, the widely used stretched C-130J-30 variant increases capacity to 8 pallets, 128 combat troops, or 92 paratroopers by adding 15 feet to the fuselage. Personnel are typically arranged in four rows of canvas seats running lengthwise in the cargo bay. 
Cargo Bay and Weight Limits
Both the C-130H and standard C-130J feature a cargo compartment approximately 40 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 9 feet high. The C-130J-30 extends the floor length to 55 feet. Regarding weight, the C-130H has a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 155,000 lbs and a maximum allowable payload of 42,000 lbs. The C-130J increases MTOW to 164,000 lbs, with the C-130J-30 capable of carrying a maximum payload of approximately 44,500 lbs. 
Fuel Usage and Performance
The C-130J is notably more fuel-efficient than the H-model, primarily due to its Rolls-Royce AE 2100D3 engines and six-bladed composite propellers. While specific burn rates vary by mission, the C-130J consumes roughly 15% to 20% less fuel while providing significantly more thrust and a 40% greater range (over 2,000 miles vs. 1,200 miles for the H-model at maximum normal payload). The C-130J also features a reduced crew requirement of just three members (two pilots and a loadmaster), whereas the C-130H typically requires five (adding a navigator and flight engineer).
