The application currently has Tailwind styling bugs — some components don’t scroll properly, while others overflow off-screen on smaller viewports.

I need you to go through the entire project and refactor all styling to enforce a consistent, responsive layout system.

Apply these strict design and styling rules globally:

Container Rules:

Use container mx-auto px-4 for page-level wrappers.

Max width: max-w-7xl.

All pages should have vertical padding (py-8 or more).

Flex & Grid Layouts:

Always use flex flex-col for main vertical layouts.

Avoid fixed heights unless absolutely necessary — prefer min-h-screen for full-height pages.

Use overflow-y-auto or overflow-x-auto for scrollable sections.

Responsive Rules:

Use Tailwind responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) to make all layouts adaptive.

No horizontal overflow on mobile. Ensure all components fit within w-full or max-w-full.

Text and spacing should scale down gracefully on smaller screens.

Scroll Behavior:

Any component or section that can overflow vertically must include overflow-y-auto and max-h-[calc(100vh-<header/footer heights>)] if needed.

Ensure no double-scrollbars appear on mobile.

Component Boundaries:

Use consistent spacing between components (gap-4 to gap-6).

Buttons, cards, modals, tables, and forms should all stay within the viewport.

For modals and dialogs, use fixed inset-0 flex items-center justify-center and max-h-screen overflow-y-auto.

Typography and Padding:

Use Tailwind typography scale (text-base, text-lg, etc.) — no inline styles.

Use p-4, p-6, or p-8 consistently for internal padding.

General Rules:

Replace any hard-coded CSS with Tailwind utility classes.

Check every page and component for overflow or responsiveness issues.

Test layouts for sm, md, and lg breakpoints.

Goal:
Refactor the entire app’s Tailwind styling to follow these rules, ensuring full responsiveness and no scroll/overflow issues.

Start by listing the files you’ll modify, then apply changes systematically. If you detect structural layout issues, fix them too (e.g., wrapping content in proper containers or adjusting flex/grid structure).
