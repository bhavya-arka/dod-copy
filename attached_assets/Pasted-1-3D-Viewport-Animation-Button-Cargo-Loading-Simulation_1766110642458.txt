1️⃣ 3D Viewport Animation Button – Cargo Loading Simulation

Purpose:
A button in the 3D viewport that triggers a fully dynamic cargo loading simulation, showing the exact order in which items are loaded into a plane or vehicle.

Feature List:

Dynamic Animation Trigger

Button appears contextually in the 3D viewport when cargo objects are present.

On click, dynamically calculates loading sequence based on cargo size, weight, and flight constraints.

No hardcoded sequences; sequence adapts to changes in cargo or plane configuration in real-time.

3D Cargo Simulation

Smooth, physics-based animation of cargo moving into position.

Visualizes realistic stacking, balancing, and pallet constraints.

Supports mixed cargo types: pallets, loose items, hazmat, special equipment.

Interactive Controls

Pause, rewind, fast-forward animation.

Option to highlight next item in sequence with a glow or outline effect.

Ability to rotate and zoom viewport during animation.

Performance & Responsiveness

Efficient WebGL / Three.js integration for high-performance rendering.

Lazy loading of 3D assets to prevent UI lag.

Responsive design: adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining button accessibility.

Real-time Data Integration

Reads cargo manifest dynamically from app state or API.

Updates animation sequence immediately when cargo list changes.

No static hardcoding of cargo or sequence.

Tailwind & UI Practices

Button uses Tailwind utility classes for responsive sizing, hover/active states, and transitions.

Tooltip support explaining button function.

Accessible focus states and keyboard navigation.

2️⃣ Flight Information Window – Loading Order PDF Export

Purpose:
On any flight info window, provide a dynamic PDF export showing exact loading order with a 2D visual layout of cargo placement.

Feature List:

Dynamic PDF Generation

Generates PDF on-demand when user clicks “Export Loading Order.”

Reads the current cargo list, sequence, and position dynamically—no hardcoded content.

Supports multi-page PDFs for large cargo manifests.

High-Resolution 2D Visuals

2D schematic of plane/vehicle cargo layout with clear visual markers.

Color-coded or icon-based representation for different cargo types (hazmat, pallets, equipment).

Adaptive layout scaling for different page sizes (A4, Letter, etc.) while preserving clarity.

Detailed Item Information

For each cargo item: name, dimensions, weight, pallet number, destination location within plane.

Sequence number indicating loading order.

Optional metadata: hazardous item flag, special handling instructions.

Optimized Engine

Utilizes dynamic layout algorithms to minimize empty space while respecting stacking and placement rules.

Caching of intermediate layout calculations for faster repeated exports.

Uses vector graphics (SVG or canvas-based) to ensure sharp visuals at any resolution.

Responsive Integration

Works on every flight info window without extra configuration.

PDF generation adapts dynamically to changes in cargo manifest or user edits.

Export button styled with Tailwind: responsive sizing, hover/active states, clear labeling.

Deep Dynamic Coding Practices

No hardcoded sequences, positions, or visuals—entire layout computed at runtime.

Modular, reusable functions for layout, graphics rendering, and PDF composition.

Fully testable and debuggable: can preview layout before export.

Easily extendable for additional metadata or export formats.

✅ Notes for Implementation

Use Three.js or equivalent for 3D viewport animations.

Use jsPDF + SVG/Canvas or PDFKit for high-quality dynamic PDF generation.

Tailwind utilities for all buttons, modals, and layouts to maintain visual responsiveness.

Ensure modular architecture: cargo logic, PDF layout engine, and animation engine should all be loosely coupled and reusable.
