Hello Phillip,


This is a friendly reminder that we have a meeting booked on:
Dec 16, 2025 3:00 PM CST (-06:00)

We'll be talking about the following:
Hello,

We’re excited to host you for Tech Tuesday! Below is important information to ensure a smooth and impactful virtual presentation.

Important Update
In accordance with new government and military guidelines, all Tech Tuesday presentations are now conducted via Microsoft Teams (MS Teams). All attendees and presenters must have a Microsoft Account to participate.

About Tech Tuesday
Your capability was selected for its transformational potential. This is your opportunity to pitch directly to Warfighters—similar to “Shark Tank”—highlighting the problem, your solution, and the Warfighter impact.

Time: 10 minutes uninterrupted, followed by 5 minutes Q&A
Format: Keep introductions brief; avoid excessive company history or overly technical detail.
Purpose: This is a discovery event, not a contract solicitation.
SOFWERX Role
SOFWERX, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, operates under a Partnership Intermediary Agreement between DEFENSEWERX and USSOCOM. We act as a neutral facilitator—we do not own IP or patents, but connect innovative capabilities with the right government and military stakeholders.

Agenda (20 minutes total)

2 minutes – SOFWERX welcome & session intro
10 minutes – Your uninterrupted presentation (slides/video recommended)
5 minutes – Q&A (facilitated by SOFWERX)
3 minutes – Transition to next presenter
Audience

Primarily USSOCOM with RSVPs from a range of government agencies
No other industry attendees besides your team
Five Eyes (FVEY) representatives may attend (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK, US) – notify us of any export/import restrictions
Presentation Materials

Share directly from your computer (ensure audio is enabled for videos)
We can share materials with verified .mil and .gov recipients via a secure government-only platform
Reminders

Join the call 10 minutes early
Use your unique dial-in link (provided separately)

Dry Run
Optional dry runs are offered the day of your presentation between 2:00–2:30 PM EST. Dry runs typically take less than 15 minutes and are a chance to test MS Teams features and screen sharing. To reserve a slot, email: Amanda.roark@sofwerx.org

We look forward to your presentation and appreciate your commitment to delivering impactful solutions for the Warfighter!

Best regards,
Amanda Roark
